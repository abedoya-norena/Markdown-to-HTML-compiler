    HINT:
    Italics require carefully tracking the beginning and ending positions of the text to be replaced.
    This is similar to the `delete_HTML` function that we implemented in class.
    It's a tiny bit more complicated since we are not just deleting substrings from the text,
    but also adding replacement substrings.
